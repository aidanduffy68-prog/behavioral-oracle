## 📢 Recent Updates

**October 20, 2025**
- Published AI Reverse Oracles research article
- Launched live retention dashboard with 9 days of data (42% retention, 4.2× baseline)
- Added protocol lifetime stats and live timestamp to dashboard
- Control group tracking coming October 23
- Expanded outreach to oracle protocols and DeFi companies

## Core Thesis

**We built the first reverse oracle.**

Traditional oracles measure asset prices (BTC/USD, ETH/USD). Reverse oracles measure trader behavior (retention, churn, LTV).

**The missing oracle layer:** Nobody's measuring "Will this trader come back after liquidation?" We are.

**Trader retention is a liquidity problem.** Exchanges continuously balance retention incentives (FRY tokens) and trader attention (activity, deposits, volume) to keep users engaged after liquidations. We're building an AMM to automate this at scale.

**Instead of tokens ↔ tokens, we trade: Retention signals ↔ Trader attention**

### Current Implementation Status

**Live (MVP):**
- ✅ FRY Token (ERC20)
- ✅ Wreckage Processor (liquidation → FRY minting at 2.26×)
- ✅ Chainlink Price Feeds (BTC/USD, ETH/USD)
- ✅ Prediction Markets (experimental feature, separate from retention)

**In Development:**
- 🔄 Retention Oracle (30-day tracking system)
- 🔄 Bonding Curve AMM (automated retention pricing)
- 🔄 Cross-exchange tracking infrastructure
- 🔄 LP pool mechanics

**Note:** Part 2 article describes the full vision. Current code is MVP demonstrating core mechanics (liquidation → FRY minting). Full AMM implementation follows data validation phase.

### Live Retention Data (Updated October 20, 2025)

**Early Results (9 days post-launch):**
- **12 wallets tracked** (received FRY post-liquidation)
- **5 wallets returned** (42% retention rate)
- **4.2× baseline** (industry baseline at 9 days: ~10%)
- **$2,847 FRY distributed** at 2.26× liquidation value

**What this means:**
- Small sample size (pilot phase)
- Directional signal, not conclusive proof
- Full 30-day data: November 10, 2025
- Even at 42%, this is 4× better than doing nothing

## What We Do

### 1. Research (Competitive Intelligence)

We analyze DeFi infrastructure across three layers:

**Layer 1: Oracle & Price Discovery**
- Lighter (ZK-proven matching), Stork (pull oracles), Pyth, Chainlink

**Layer 2: Liquidity & Risk Management**
- Variational (OLP), Vertex, Hyperliquid, dYdX v4

**Layer 3: Retention Infrastructure**
- **FRY Protocol (our solution)** - Nobody else is building here

📖 **[Read our October 10 analysis](https://mirror.xyz/0xf551aF8d5373B042DBB9F0933C59213B534174e4/i8FZxbZRcqG8IVG6AWyMC3TvMmSYFeG1Q3QDrfGZUp0)** - Oracle failure, market maker withdrawal, and why retention infrastructure matters.

### 2. Build (FRY Protocol)

**The Problem:**
- 82% of liquidated traders quit forever
- Exchanges lose their most active users
- Death spiral: liquidations → attrition → less liquidity → more liquidations

**The Solution:**
- Mint FRY tokens at 2.26× liquidation value
- 6-month vesting (prevents dump, creates re-engagement)
- Tradeable, stakeable, fee discounts
- Psychological shift: "I lost money" → "I got something back"

**The Result:**
- **Target: 50%+ retention vs 18% baseline**
- **2.7× improvement potential**
- Growth spiral instead of death spiral
- Early validation: October 11 launch tracking in progress

### October 10, 2025: The Validation Event

- **$19.3B destroyed** in liquidation cascade
- **1.6M traders** liquidated
- **82% quit forever** (industry baseline)
- **FRY thesis validated**: Retention infrastructure is the missing layer

**Tech Stack:**
- Smart Contracts: Solidity 0.8.19, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat
- Oracles: Chainlink Price Feeds (BTC/USD, ETH/USD)
- Network: Arbitrum Mainnet
- Research: Mirror, Dune Analytics

## Quick Start

### Use the Protocol
1. Visit [Live Demo](https://aidanduffy68-prog.github.io/USD_FRY/)
2. Connect wallet (Arbitrum mainnet)
3. Process wreckage or bet on prediction markets

### Deploy Contracts
```bash
cd liquidity-rails/core/contracts
npm install
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

---

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WreckageProcessorWithOracle** - Processes losses with Chainlink-verified prices
2. **FRYPredictionMarket** - Auto-resolving prediction markets
3. **USD_FRY Token** - ERC20 token minted from processed wreckage

### How It Works

```
Trading Loss → Chainlink Price Verification → FRY Minting (2.26x) → Tradeable Token
```

### Prediction Markets (Experimental)
**Note:** Separate feature from retention oracle. Testing FRY distribution mechanics.

- Create markets about crypto prices, events, etc.
- Bet with USDC
- Auto-resolve using Chainlink oracles
- Losers receive FRY tokens (2.26x their loss)
- Winners receive 70% of losing pool

## Why This Matters

### The Unsolved Problem

**Even with perfect infrastructure:**
- Perfect oracles (Lighter) prevent manipulation ✓
- Perfect liquidity (Variational) prevent cascades ✓
- **But traders still get liquidated on legitimate moves**
- **And 82% still quit**

**FRY is the only solution addressing post-liquidation retention.**

### Competitive Positioning

**We Are NOT:**
- Another oracle provider (Lighter/Stork/Pyth do this)
- Another liquidity solution (Variational/Vertex do this)
- Another DEX (we integrate with all of them)

**We ARE:**
- The retention layer that makes all DEXs better
- Competitive intelligence firm for DeFi infrastructure
- The only team building Layer 3 (retention)

### Use Cases

**For Exchanges:**
- Integrate FRY to reduce 82% attrition to 30%
- 3.9× more retained users = 3.9× more trading volume
- Non-competitive: works with any oracle/liquidity solution

**For Traders:**
- Get 2.26× FRY tokens after liquidation
- Vesting schedule creates reason to stay engaged
- Fee discounts + staking rewards on future trades

**For Researchers:**
- Access our competitive intelligence on DeFi infrastructure
- Collaborate on oracle/liquidity/retention research
- Cite our published analysis

## FAQ

### Token Economics

**Q: What's the FRY supply schedule? How does this avoid becoming another incentive-farming dust token?**

- **Elastic supply**: Minted on-demand at 2.26× liquidation value (no pre-mine, no VC allocation)
- **Inflation control**: 6-month vesting + churn burn = deflationary pressure
- **Net inflation**: ~40% of liquidation value (only 18% of minted FRY fully vests)
- **Anti-farming**: Vesting cliff, activity multiplier, cross-exchange tracking, churn burn

### Competitive Analysis

**Q: What stops every exchange from building their own retention token?**

Nothing. They should. But cross-exchange AMM provides:
- **Portable retention**: FRY earned on Hyperliquid works on dYdX
- **Better data**: Oracle tracks traders across all venues
- **Network effects**: More exchanges = more valuable FRY
- **Anti-farming**: Can't game the system by hopping exchanges

**Competitive moat**: First-mover advantage, oracle infrastructure, "reverse oracles" brand. Realistic outcome: become "Chainlink for retention."

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Data Validation (Current - 2-4 weeks)**
- Run October 10 analysis via Allium
- Validate retention predictions on real liquidation data
- Success metric: Prediction accuracy >70%

**Phase 2: Single-Exchange Pilot (Q1 2026 - 3-6 months)**
- Target: Hyperliquid
- 1,000 liquidated traders receive FRY
- Success metrics: 30-day return rate >30% (vs. 18% baseline), 2× LTV vs. control

**Phase 3: Cross-Exchange Expansion (Q2-Q3 2026 - 6-9 months)**
- Integrate 2-3 additional exchanges (dYdX, Vertex, Drift)
- Launch cross-exchange oracle
- Success metrics: 3+ exchanges, 10,000+ traders, validated cross-exchange data

**Phase 4: Decentralization (Q4 2026 - 12+ months)**
- Decentralized oracle network
- Governance token launch
- Open-source AMM contracts
- Success metrics: 10+ exchanges, $10M+ TVL
